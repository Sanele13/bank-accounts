# BankAccounts

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.4.

## How the application works

A page shows a list of accounts. When the 'Withdraw' button is clicked, an alert message is displayed.

Additionally, it displays the change in account balance and recalculates the total balance. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
